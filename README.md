# 🗣️ Speech-to-Text Transcription with Deep Learning  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project implements a **Speech-to-Text transcription system** inspired by **DeepSpeech2**, leveraging **deep learning techniques** to convert spoken language into text. The model is trained on the **LJSpeech dataset** and utilizes **spectrogram-based feature extraction, GRU-based RNN layers, and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss** for training. The transcription quality is evaluated using **Word Error Rate (WER)**.  

## 🔊 Dataset  
The model is trained on the [LJSpeech Dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/), which includes:  
- **13,100** high-quality speech recordings from a single English speaker.  
- **Corresponding transcriptions** provided in `transcripts.csv`.  
- Audio sampled at **22.05 kHz**, making it suitable for speech synthesis and recognition research.  

## 🏗️ Model Architecture  
The project implements:  

- **Feature Extraction:**  
  - Converts audio signals into **spectrograms** for neural network processing.  
  - Utilizes **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)** to enhance speech feature representation.  

- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model:**  
  - **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** layers for sequential learning.  
  - **Batch normalization** and **dropout** for improved generalization.  
  - **CTC loss function** to align predicted sequences with actual transcriptions.  

## 🔧 Training Strategy  
- **Loss Function:** **CTC Loss** to handle variable-length input sequences.  
- **Optimization:** Adam Optimizer with dynamic learning rate adjustments.  
- **Evaluation Metric:** **Word Error Rate (WER)** to measure transcription accuracy.  

## 📈 Results and Findings  
- The model successfully transcribes spoken words into text.  
- Performance improves with training, as indicated by a decreasing **WER**.  
- Spectrogram-based features enhance recognition capabilities, making transcription more accurate.  

## ⚡ Key Challenges  
- Handling variations in speech tone and pronunciation.  
- Optimizing hyperparameters for better sequence-to-sequence learning.  
- Improving generalization to unseen speech data.  

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project  
1. Ensure the dataset is downloaded and stored correctly.  
2. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python speech_to_text.py
   ```  
3. View the transcription results and performance evaluation.  

## 📚 Future Improvements  
- Implement **Transformer-based architectures** like Wav2Vec2 for enhanced transcription.  
- Train on larger multi-speaker datasets for better generalization.  
- Fine-tune the model to recognize diverse accents and speech styles.
